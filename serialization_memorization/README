Considering serializing a linked list structure rather than array structure.

The serialization process would recursively resolve the data which would cause call stack overflow.

The solution is to flatten the callstack by iteratively serializing.

i.e.
The data object is 
datalist := A -> B -> C -> ... -> Z

Solution1.
Recode the data to array.
datalist[] := ABC...Z

Solution2.
Use a array to store the element in reverse order of linked list. Then serialize it.
presave_array[] := Z...CBA
datalist := A -> B -> C -> ... -> Z
